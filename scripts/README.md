basic_drive_1.py -- Drives to one goal position and stops (not used anymore, kept for recording keeping's sake)

basic_drive_2.py -- Loops goals from a list (also not used at the moment)

basic_drive_3.py -- Same as 2, but more organized into functions

basic_drive_4.py -- Same as 3, but uses Dubins model to create series of points between goals, and uses a look-ahead radius

(todo) basic_drive_5.py -- Using 4, but taking out Dubins and keeping look-ahead. This drive routine is for testing a course of tightly-spaced GPS points to follow.
